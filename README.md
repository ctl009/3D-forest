# 3D Reconstruction of Forest Scenery

Real-time 3D reconstruction of a forest scene from 360-camera footage using Gaussian Splatting methods.

## Features

- Converts 360-camera images into 3D scenes using structure-from-motion and COLMAP
- Implements and compares 3DGS, Compact3DGS, EAGLES, and Splatfacto
- Evaluates tradeoffs in memory use, quality, and rendering time
- Demonstrates high-detail reconstructions using the OpenCV camera model
